# Pong
The Pong game made in python using turtle.
Runs on a 800x600 window
Uses the up and down arrow keys for the right paddle (player1) and the W and S keys for the left paddle (player2).
Due to a bug in the turtle module, on some computers you have to repeatedly tap the keys for the paddles to move whereas on some you can just hold the keys down.
The speed increases with every bounce to make the game more fun and challenging.
Scoreboard on the top keeps track of scores for both player 1 and player 2 seperately.
